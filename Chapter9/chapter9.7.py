# 9-7. Admin: An administrator is a special kind of user. 
# Write a class called Admin that inherits from the User class you wrote in 
# Exercise 9-3 (page 162) or Exercise 9-5 (page 167). Add an attribute, 
# privileges, that stores a list of strings like "can add post", 
# "can delete post", "can ban user", and so on. Write a method called 
# show_privileges() that lists the administratorâ€™s set of privileges. 
# Create an instance of Admin, and call your method.
