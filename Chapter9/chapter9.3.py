# 9-3. Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name 
# and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically 
# stored in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a 
# summary of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() 
# that prints a personalized greeting to the user.

from Classes.User import User

#Instance variable
