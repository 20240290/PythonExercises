# 7-4. Pizza Toppings: Write a loop that prompts the user to enter a series of pizza toppings until they enter a 'quit' value. As they enter each topping, print a message saying youâ€™ll add that topping to their pizza.

#initialize empty toppings string
toppings = ""
prompt = "\nPlease add your toppings. Enter 'quit' to end the program.\n"

#Iterate each toppings while its not equal to 'quit'
while toppings != 'quit':
    toppings = input(prompt)
    if toppings != 'quit':
        print(f"You added {toppings} to your pizza!")
else:
    print("......")
