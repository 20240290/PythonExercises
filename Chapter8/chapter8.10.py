# 8-10. Sending Messages: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 8-9. 
# Write a function called send_messages() that prints each text message and 
# moves each message to a new list called sent_messages as itâ€™s printed. 
# After calling the function, print both of your lists to 
# make sure the messages were moved correctly.
